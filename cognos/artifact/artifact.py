"""
Artifact Creation:

* **Tracking and Aggregation:**
    * Develop a mechanism to capture and store context, research notes, and chats during file generation.
    * Implement data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) for efficient data storage.
* **Compilation:**
    * Design logic to assemble the collected data into a coherent and easily navigable markdown file.
    * Implement markdown formatting and structuring techniques for clarity and organization.
* **Dependency Resolution:**
    * Ensure artifact creation occurs only after all other processes have completed.
    * Implement dependency management mechanisms (e.g., events, flags) for coordinated execution.
