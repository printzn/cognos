## ${{positioning}}
A file is usually generated with some amount of useful ${{context}}. It may take the form of (for example):
    Other files, functions, classes, and methods within the ${{project_dir}}
    A goal; what is the stated-purpose of the file
    An impetus; what is the impelling-factor, stimulus, or situation which gives rise to the ${{goal}} and this file
    Positioning; Like a verbose-NLP 'type', positioning is LLM/human generated meta-cognition and is-abstractly
        represented as any-aspect of this additional file ${{metadata}} but which will specifically be instantiated-
        at the top of each file.
    Research; all the useful documents, websites, files, etc. which were used-in any of these processes
    Chats; as this repo is primarily human-bot collaboration it is important to treat 'chats', or queries and responses,
        which were generated in-process of these required, contextual, generally-abstracted as
            ${{positioning}} & ${{context}}
    Artifact: The ${{artifact}} of a file is markdown-formatted collection of all of this meta-data inside a single,
        easily traversable file which is human-readable. An artifact differs from positioning because positioning is
        in-file meta-data (usually near the top and/or bottom of the file itself) while an artifact is a file object
        in-that it is itself a file, but is only-generated when a file created in a buddy-system. Every file has an
        associated file, its {{artifact}}

3. Positioning Injection:

* **Metadata Collection:**
    * Define and collect relevant metadata about the file, including context, research, and chats.
    * Design a data structure for structured metadata representation.
* **Injection Logic:**
    * Develop logic to automatically inject positioning metadata into the header of generated files.
    * Consider options for injecting metadata at various points during the file generation process.
* **Consistency:**
    * Implement mechanisms to ensure consistency of positioning information across related files.
    * Utilize version control systems or checksums to maintain data integrity.
