"""
NoteTopic Interface:

* **Async Communication:**
    * Implement an asynchronous communication system for NoteTopic to exchange data during file generation and artifact creation.
    * Consider using message queues (e.g., asyncio.Queue) or publish-subscribe patterns for efficient data exchange.
* **Return Mechanism:**
    * Design a mechanism for NoteTopic to return stored data back to the system.
    * Options include returning data as text/code for NLP processing or including it directly in the artifact file.
